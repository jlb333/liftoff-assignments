## Submission Instructions

### Overview
With a background in social work, it would be helpful to have a dynamic web application that contains all the St. Louis resources in one spot.  I’ve referred people to different resources, but don’t always get to hear back from clients as to whether the service was helpful.  I would like to create a way for users to review the agencies, so others can learn what services are truly legitimate and helpful. 

For now, I plan to create a searchable web application that focuses on available resources in the St. Louis area, utilizing information gathered in PDF format from the Start Here STL Resource Directory.  I would then like to create user review functionality and ultimately it would be helpful to turn it in to a downloadable mobile web application.    
  
### Features
1.)	Search:  search feature based on the different sections of the STL Resource Guide.

2.)	User login:  Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application.  Each user will have a profile page.  

3.)	Create Review:  Logged in users will be able to review resources/agencies.  The reviews users have created will appear on their profile page.  

4.)	Display Reviews:  Reviews of an existing agency will be visible to logged in users when the user selects an agency.  

5.)  PDF Scraping 

### Technologies
•	Java
•	Spring Boot
•	Thymeleaf
•	Bootstrap
•	MySQL


### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn more about PDF Scrapers and if it is applicable to the information I want to extract from the STL Resource Guide.  I will also need to learn more about Bootstrap and how to add review functionality.  Overall, I want to better understand all the technologies listed above and how they interact with one another.
